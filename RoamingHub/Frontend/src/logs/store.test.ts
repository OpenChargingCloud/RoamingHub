/**
 * What the browser's copy of the log does when the stream stops.
 *
 * Run with `npm test`, which is Node's own runner reading the TypeScript as it
 * stands - no bundler, no browser, no dependency that is not already here.
 *
 * What is pinned is what was measured to be wrong, on the vehicle whose Logs
 * page this is: it was stopped and started again, which takes every session
 * with it, and the browser's retry then got a 401 - which it treats as final.
 * The page went on saying "reconnecting ..." over a frozen list, with the
 * vehicle up and running and the operator signed out without being told. The
 * hub ends a stream by itself as well, when the session that opened it has
 * ended. EV's test, carried over with the store.
