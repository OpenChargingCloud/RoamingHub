/**
 * Everything this hub believes, everything it presents, and the servers it
 * recognises.
 *
 * Two groups, and the difference between them is the whole shape of this page.
 * A **root** is what this hub believes: any number of each kind may be on at
 * once, and switching one off changes what chains are accepted from then on.
 * A **credential** is what this hub presents in TLS, with its private key.
 * Beside them the **server certificates**, which are neither: kept so that a
 * time server or a name server can be held to one of them by its fingerprint,
 * on the NTS and the DNS page.
 *
 * A hub keeps the four kinds of TLS and none of ISO 15118's, which are a
 * vehicle's and a charging station's. The store says which kinds it keeps,
 * and the page shows those and offers nothing else: offering a kind the store
 * refuses would be offering a refusal.
 *
 * A TLS root and a server certificate are told what they are for - the time
 * servers, the name servers, or every use - when they are uploaded, and can
 * be told again: a root uploaded for the name servers vouches for no time.
 *
 * Certificates arrive two ways and both are first class. "Import" uploads a
 * file and copies it in; "Re-read the directory" picks up whatever somebody put
 * there by hand, which on a machine you already have a shell on is the shorter
 * path. Either way the store ends up the same, because the store is the
 * directory.
