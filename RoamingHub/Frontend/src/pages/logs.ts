/**
 * Everything that happens inside the hub, as it happens.
 *
 * The entries arrive over one Server-Sent Events stream and go in at the top,
 * newest first, so that what just happened is where the eye already is and
 * nobody has to chase a growing list downwards. The filters work on what is
 * already in the browser, so changing one costs nothing and asks the hub for
 * nothing. A list that is scrolled to the top follows along; scrolling
 * down stops that, which is what somebody reading an older line wants - and
 * the button that floats over the top of the list brings them back.
 *
 * The store keeps its entries oldest first and is left alone: that order is
 * what its own de-duplication and its bounded trim are written against. Only
 * what is drawn is reversed, by drawOrder and entryAt in logs/order.ts, which
 * the three places that map a line to an entry all go through.
 *
 * The Logs page of the vehicle, the charging station and the local
 * controller, one page since EV ffde510 - and now the hub's as well.
