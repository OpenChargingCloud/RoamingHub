    /// A whole RoamingHub per test rather than one for the fixture, because
    /// half of what is worth testing here changes the RoamingHub: a test that
    /// repoints the name servers must not decide what the next test reads. One
    /// costs a few hundred milliseconds, which is cheaper than the morning
    /// spent on a test that only fails when it runs second.
    ///
    /// Each one gets a directory of its own for the two files it writes, and a
    /// port the operating system has just confirmed is free - so a developer
    /// with a RoamingHub running on 2350 can still run the tests.
    ///
    /// **Nothing here reaches the network.** The configuration written before
    /// the RoamingHub is built switches the time client off, which is what
    /// stops the clock check from ever being scheduled; the DNS client is only
    /// ever asked what it is configured as, never to resolve anything. Tests
    /// that want a name looked up or a time server asked belong somewhere that
    /// is allowed to be offline and fail.
